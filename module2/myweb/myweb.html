        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p class="mylife1"> Hello! I’m Tristan Elasi, born in January 2001. With extensive experience in customer service roles, I excel in fast-paced environments and enjoy both team-based and solo work. I'm a quick learner with a strong work ethic, skilled in managing stock, handling customer transactions, and resolving issues. I’ve developed a keen interest in software development and am eager to transition into this field. I’m excited about the opportunity to apply my problem-solving skills and enthusiasm for technology to new and innovative projects.</p>
        <div class="mylife2">As a beginner just embarking on my journey into web development, I have begun to explore the fundamentals of these technologies, learning how HTML structures content, CSS styles and lays out web pages, and JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic functionality. My initial projects have provided me with hands-on experience in creating simple web pages and experimenting with basic features. I am eager to build on this foundation, deepen my understanding, and develop practical skills that will enable me to create more complex and engaging web applications.</div>
